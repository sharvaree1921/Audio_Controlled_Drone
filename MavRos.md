**PX4 Autopilot**: It's an open source autopilot system oriented towards inexpensive autonomous aircraft.

**Autopilot**: A device for keeping an aircraft on a set course without the intervention of the pilot. Acting or functioning without conscious thought,
as a result of routine or habit.

**ArduPilot** is an open source, unmanned vehicle Autopilot Software Suite, capable of controlling autonomous: Multirotor drones. Fixed-wing and VTOL aircraft. 
Helicopters.
(_A software suite or application suite is a collection of computer programs — usually application software or programming software — of related functionality, 
often sharing a similar user interface and the ability to easily exchange data with each other_)

**MAVROS** is a ROS “node” that can convert between ROS topics and MAVLink messages allowing ArduPilot vehicles to communicate with ROS.

**MAVLink** -- Micro Air Vehicle Message Marshalling Library.
MAVLink is a very lightweight, header-only message library for communication between drones and/or ground control stations. It consists primarily of message-set specifications for different systems ("dialects") defined in XML files, and Python tools that convert these into appropriate source code for supported languages. There are additional Python scripts providing examples and utilities for working with MAVLink data.

_Mavros_ (opens new window) is a ROS (1) package that enables MAVLink extendable communication between computers running ROS (1) for any MAVLink enabled autopilot, ground station, or peripheral. MAVROS is the "official" supported bridge between ROS (1) and the MAVLink protocol.
